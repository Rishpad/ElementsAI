# ChangeTheEnigma (CTE)

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

ChangeTheEnigma (CTE) is an AI solution designed to help hospitals access immediate funds when insurance payments are delayed. It ensures continuous care without financial loss or dependence on loans.

Building AI course project

## Background

Hospitals often operate at a loss when insurance payouts are delayed, forcing them to borrow or cut corners. This delay impacts both operational efficiency and patient care. CTE aims to solve this by analyzing and optimizing the cash flow process.

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* Late insurance payments
* Borrowing to cover operating costs
* Interrupted or delayed patient care

## How is it used?

Hospitals input payment timelines, patient inflow, and pending insurance claims. The AI predicts shortfalls and recommends funding solutions or triggers early-payment options from financial partners.
